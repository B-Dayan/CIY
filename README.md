# CIY
A game-dev project with a modular level design, made in the Unity game engine. Each level is more programatically complex then its predecessor and functions almost as its own game. The levels are organized into "scenes," each of which have a more-advanced visual style than previous scenes.

# Purpose of Level Design
The modular, easy-to-build-upon design of the levels allows me to have freedom in programming new areas. This is useful since I created the project to improve/practice my programming & designing abilities. With this setup, I can essentially connect an unlimited number of smaller game projects into one experience.

# Summary of Gameplay
Scene 0, level 0 consits of the player controlling a white square in a black void. When they cross the edge of the screen, they move to the next level, a simple maze made of large pixels with a yellow square representing a key. Once the key is collected and the player once again crosses the boundry of the screen's edge, the third level begins. This new maze is made of smaller pixels, creating a more challenging area to navigate. The fourth and final level, a circular maze with a key waiting in the center, introduces a rotating "firewall" that kills the player upon contact, resetting the level.

Scene 1, in contrast to the first scene, has graphics made from 16-bit pixel art and animation instead of 1-bit. The first level simply allows the player to get used to the new graphics, while the second includes an NPC enemy that follows the player with the intent to kill.
